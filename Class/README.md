## Class assignments & Topics:

* #### Problem Set 0.
    This problem set will introduce you to the programming environment Spyder from the Anaconda Distribution of Python, and to programming in Python, as well as to our general problem set structure. In this problem set, you will confirm your installation of Python, write a simple Python program, and hand it in.
	
* #### Problem Set 1.
    This problem set will introduce you to using control flow in Python and formulating a computational  solution to a problem.  It will also give you a chance to explore bisection search.  This problem set has  three ​problems.  You should save your code for the first problem as ​ps1a.py​, the second problem as  ps1b.py​ and the third problem as ​ps1c.py​, and make sure to hand in all three files.  Don't forget to  include comments to help us understand your code!
	
* #### Problem Set 2.
    This problem set will introduce you to the topic of creating functions in Python, as well  as looping mechanisms for repeating a computational process until a condition is  reached. 

* #### Problem Set 3.
    In this problem set, you'll implement a version of the 6.0001 word game! 
Don't be intimidated by the length of this problem set. It's a lot of reading, but it is very doable. 
Let's begin by describing the word game: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each ​valid​ word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word. The rules of the game are as follows. ​Do not start coding yet – as in Pset 2, we will break this down into steps below!

* #### Problem Set 4.
    This problem set has two parts.  The first part allows you to practice thinking about problems in a recursive fashion, taking advantage of the idea that one can reduce the problem to a simpler version of the same problem.  In ​ps4a.py​, you will write a recursive function that takes as input a string and figures out all the possible reorderings of the characters in the string. 
 
    The second part will give you experience in thinking about problems in terms of classes, each instance of which contains specific attributes as well as methods for manipulating them.  In ​ps4b.py​, you will use object-oriented programming to write a Caesar/shift cipher.  In ps4c.py ​ ​, you will use object-oriented programming to write a very simple substitution cipher. 
 
    As always, please do not rename the files we provide you with, change any of the provided helper functions, change function/method names, or delete provided docstrings. You will need to keep ​words.txt​ and ​story.txt​ in the same folder in which you store ​ps4a.py, ps4b.py​ and ​ps4c.py​.
