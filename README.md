## Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised exercises:


#### Finger exercise:
###### Problem - 01.
Write a program that examines three variables—x, y, and z—
and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it
should print a message to that effect.

###### Problem - 02.
Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and
then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd number was
entered, it should print a message to that effect.

###### Problem - 03.
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and
prints two integers, root and pwr, such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal
to the integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should
print a message to that effect.
